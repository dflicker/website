   <h1>About me</h1>
   I'm a junior at the California Institute of Technology studying computer science. My interests lie in robotics especially in using control theory to provide greater autonomy. However, I'm also reading about distributed systems and web technology. I'm part of the <a href="http://crt.caltech.edu/">Caltech Robotics Team</a>, which is currently developing an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for AUVSI/ONR's <a href="http://robosub.org">RoboSub competition</a>. My role is electronics lead, responsible for the vehicle's communications, power, underwater acoustics and computing hardware systems.
<p>
Personal interests include swimming for Caltech's NCAA Div. III swim team, lifting weights, cooking, and building miscellaneous electonic/software projects.
